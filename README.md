# python-markdown-gists
An extension to Python Markdown to process links to gists.

See https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/

Python Markdown Gists will preprocess a markdown file looking for lines which only contain a gist link. If it finds one it will replace those lines with the content of the gist.
